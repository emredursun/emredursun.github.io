    An <strong>autonomous car</strong> (also known as a <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-driverless-car.htm">driverless car</a></strong>, <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/25/tech/innovation/self-driving-car-california/index.html">self-driving car</a></strong>, <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1721679">robotic car</a></strong>) and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_ground_vehicle"><strong>Unmanned Ground Vehicle</strong></a> is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Many such systems are evolving, but as of 2017 no cars permitted on public roads were fully autonomous. They all require a human at the wheel who must be ready to take control at any time.
    Autonomous cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. Autonomous cars must have control systems that are capable of analyzing sensory data to distinguish between different cars on the road. (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car">Wikipedia</a>, 2017).

      Volkswagen's plans to develop fully autonomous vehicles that would offer greater comfort and convenience than current cars, while slashing the number of road deaths and truly democratizing mobility, have borne their first fruit. This is Sedric, designed to be a platform for cross-brand ideas, which will feed into subsequent concepts from the group's car brands. The biggest idea it introduces is its full "Level 5" autonomy: no human driver is required.<br><br>
      <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEDRIC_06-1440x720.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
    There's no VW badge on the front of Sedric because this is the first concept car built by the Volkswagen Group, rather than the Volkswagen car brand. It was devised, designed, developed, and constructed by Volkswagen Group's Future Center Europe in Potsdam and Volkswagen Group Research in Wolfsburg. "We are systematically focusing on our customers, their wishes and requirements for the mobility of the future," says chief designer Michael Mauer. "The Volkswagen Group Future Centers give us the opportunity to conceptualize and develop new ideas of mobile life."<br><br>
      <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEDRIC_04-1440x885.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
      Volkswagen sees Sedric as either a shared mobility system operating worldwide or a vehicle from one of the group's brands that might be owned by an individual. Despite much talk in recent years about future mobility ushering in new ownership models, the company says it believes many people will continue to want to own their own automobile in the future.<br><br>
      
      The benefits offered by Sedric—the name is a portmanteau of "self-driving car"—are legion. It could drive children to school, drop their parents at the office, and then look independently for a parking space. It could collect pre-ordered shopping or meet you at the station or airport.<br>

      Volkswagen aimed to make Sedric very simple to operate, resulting in a remote control called The Button: pressing it summons Sedric and identifies the user when the car arrives. Two wide doors on each side slide open to reveal an airy interior with sofa-style seats facing towards the center.

    <h2>Classification</h2>
    <p class="paragraphs-h2">
      A classification system based on six different levels (ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems) was published in 2014 by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_International">SAE International</a>, an automotive standardization body, as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems. This classification system is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle capabilities, although these are very loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) released a formal classification system, but abandoned this system in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.

       <h2>Everyone Wants a Level 5 Self-Driving Car—Here’s What That Means</h2>
       <p class="paragraphs-h2">
         It’s been a hot summer of self-driving car news. Ford announced it’s skipping over Level 3 and will put a fleet of Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road in 2021. Mobileye and Delphi promised Level 4/5 self-drivers by 2019. Tesla’s talking about improving its Level 2 cars. Sounds exciting—if you have any idea what those numbers mean. Even when they’re using words, automakers obfuscate what their cars can do. Also floating in this stew of jargon are terms like autonomous, self-driving, semi-autonomous, and self-piloting.<br><br>
    
    Those driving levels come from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and SAE (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers), which each have their own system. They’re nearly identical, but in the name of internationalism, we’ll use SAE’s. So, as cars that drive themselves evolve and spread over the coming years, here’s a guide for understanding what’s left for you to do.

       <div class="driver-levels">
         
         <h3>LEVEL 0</h3>
         <img class="driver-levels-photos" src="https://assets.wired.com/photos/w_860/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-2672519.jpg" width="550px" >
         <p class="paragraphs-h3">
         You do all the work.
           </p>
        
       </div>
       
       <div class="driver-levels">
         
         <h3>LEVEL 1</h3>
         <img class="driver-levels-photos" src="https://assets.wired.com/photos/w_860/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-653025193.jpg" width="550px" >
         <p class="paragraphs-h3">
         <strong>Helping out.</strong>
           SAE calls Level 1 “driver assistance,” and even that feels generous. This is a car that helps out by doing a single task. Usually, that means cruise control, where the car holds whatever speed you command. No turning, no staying in its lane, no hitting the brakes before plowing into the stopped semi up ahead.
           </p>
        
       </div>
       
       <div class="driver-levels">
         
         <h3>LEVEL 2</h3>
         <img class="driver-levels-photos" src="http://insideevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/6TcxiNL-750x375.jpg" width="550px" >
         <p class="paragraphs-h3">
         <strong>Building confidence.</strong>
           Like a toddler “helping” with the dishes, a Level 2 car can “help” you drive, as long as you keep a careful eye on it. Sure, the car maintain its speed, slow down to avoid other cars, and stay in its lane. But if any trouble comes up, it’s up to the human to take over. Tesla’s “autopilot” system is the best known example, even if some drivers treat it like a more advanced system.
    
           </p>
        
       </div>
       
       <div class="driver-levels">
         
         <h3>LEVEL 3</h3>
         <img class="driver-levels-photos" src="https://assets.wired.com/photos/w_860/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/audi-jack-gallery-01.jpg" width="550px" >
         <p class="paragraphs-h3">
           <strong>Taking control.</strong>
         No one’s put a Level 3 car on the market yet, but you can expect a few within about five years. These cars don’t just stay in their lane and away from other cars, they make decisions. Instead of braking to avoid hitting that slow-moving semi, they’ll take a look around, decide to change lanes, and pass—Audi’s prototype A7 can do that. They still need a human around if the weather messes with their sensors or the painted lane lines disappear, so no falling asleep at the wheel.
           </p>
        
       </div>
       <div class="driver-levels">
         
         <h3>LEVEL 4</h3>
         <img class="driver-levels-photos" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS_3NnIHqifOE7u1HuVbqc_ljzT_OvfYC4yB8xANfmOyu6AB34Q" width="550px" >
         <p class="paragraphs-h3">
           <strong>Off to college.</strong>
         This is the stage where the human becomes expendable: The car can handle any situation all by itself, as long as it stays in its safe place. That will most likely be a geographically limited area like a college campus or city downtown. Like the set in The Truman Show, where everything’s perfectly mapped and nothing too crazy can happen (until the car/Jim Carrey figures it out and freaks out, I guess).
           </p>
        
       </div>
       
       <div class="driver-levels">
         
         <h3>LEVEL 5</h3>

         <p class="paragraphs-h3">
           <strong>Adulthood.</strong>
         This is what Google’s aiming for: The car that can handle all driving tasks and go anywhere. No human, no steering wheel, no pedals. Climb in, tell it where you want to go (if it doesn’t already know from reading your calendar), and get back to looking at your phone.
